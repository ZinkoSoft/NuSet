NuSet
=====

An open sourced Visual Studio 2013 Extension used to easily create NuGet packages out of class libraries.

The goal for this extension is to fill the gap between setting up a NuGet package and finalizing the package out to either the NuGet repository online, local, or company hosted repository. 

I have been using PSake and building the packages to the specification from http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package

Any code checkins should have a unit test, and should be added into the integration testing for the Visual Studio Extension.
